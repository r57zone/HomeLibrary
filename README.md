# Home library
Catalog your films, series, games and books.

## Setup
1. Run "ie11_enable.reg" to activate IE11 support for the application (the file is located in the application folder).
2. Add the folders you need to the "Categories.txt" file (for example: "C:\Movies", "C:\TVShows", "C:\Games", "C:\Books"). Hidden categories are also supported, they must be added to the file "HiddenCategories.txt". The password for viewing them can be changed in the "Config.ini" file.
3. Add posters or covers for your movies, TV shows, games, and books. To do this, add a file called "Cover" to the folder of the movie, game, TV series or book. It is also recommended that you create a "cover-small", a smaller version so that the download is faster and the images are more enjoyable. Recommended sizes for "cover-small" posters or covers are as follows: for movies - 100x150, for new games - 100x133 and for old games - 100x100. You can automatically download covers in the program ["MediaElch"](https://github.com/Komet/MediaElch).
4. Add, if necessary, a description for your films, series, games, and books. This can be done either manually by clicking on "+" and entering data from Wikipedia or automatically using the program ["MediaElch"](https://github.com/Komet/MediaElch) for films and TV shows. For games and books you have to fill in manually, covers in good resolution can be downloaded using the "Playnite" program (will be in the program folder - "Playnite\library\files") or also manually.
5. Add the necessary buttons to the description as necessary. By default, the "View" button is created for movies, the "Install" button for games, and the "Open" button for books and the "Open Folder" button for all categories. Additionally, you can create your own buttons, for example, to open a folder, application or file. There is an example of creating a button in the "NFO" file; if necessary, they are duplicated (the "button" sub-item, in the "buttons" item).
6. Optionally, you can exchange the functionality of the right and left mouse buttons.
